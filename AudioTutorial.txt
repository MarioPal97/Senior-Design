To install audio portion

Use "arecord -l" to see which device the microphone (or sound card) is set as
	Whichever is the index of the microphone in the list of devices, you will change the micIndex variable in tts_text.py to equal that index number
Use "alsamixer" to make sure the gain on both the earpiece and microphone is all the way up
	With the sound card we are using, it may be sufficient to leave the output volume at a medium level.

Replacing the pocketsphynx dictionary:
	Place the "en-reduced" folder in your /home/pi directory
	Then enter the command:
		sudo mv en-reduced /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/speech_recognition/pocketsphinx-data/
