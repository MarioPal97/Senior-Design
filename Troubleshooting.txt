Installing Pytesseract
Note: when installing things use the following cmd unless otherwise stated
python3 -m pip 

I followed the INSTALLATION on github: 
https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract

Then afterwards do following steps:- 

Installing via pip (Pytesseract)
python3 -m pip install pytesseract 

Errors I came accross:-

PATH ERR
Adding the PATH
export PATH=/home/pi/.local/bin:$PATH
then use following cmd to see if PATH was added
echo $PATH

Afterwards I ran the test.py and got the following errors:-

ImportError: libcblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory
